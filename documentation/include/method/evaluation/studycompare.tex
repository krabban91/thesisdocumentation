\subsection{Study comparisons}
\label{sec:meth:eval:studycomp}

Even though the proposed model is defined to become better at retrieving images iteratively and continually increasing the query set, there is still value in seeing how well a barely trained version of the proposed model compares with retrieval methods from other papers. Most CBIR system are designed to have a single image as a query, \cite{wang2001simplicity}, \cite{subrahmanyam2013modified} and \cite{nagaraja2015low} among others, which is not possible with the proposed model. A model that uses an SVM (see Section \ref{sec:mltheory:svm}) as classifier would require at least two (one relevant and one non-relevant) images in the query set in order to fit a decision boundary. The proposed model uses a Deep SVM (see Section \ref{sec:deepSVM}), that uses a K-fold split in order to fit the decision boundary for the second order classifier, and does therefore require at least four (two relevant and two non-relevant) images in the query set. In order to have a fair comparison to the other studies the query set must be kept small. But there are also studies like \cite{elalami2014new} that use a training set to attack the challenges within CBIR. A too small query set would be unfair towards the proposed model and the query set size will therefore be balanced to compare with the studies at hand.
