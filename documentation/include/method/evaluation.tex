\section{Evaluation of model}
\label{sec:meth:evaluation}

Performing evaluations in larger scales\todo{on a larger scale} often demand that labeled datasets are used\todo{``,''} and\todo{and =>whilst} the proposed model is designed to have a user standing by after\todo{remove after} each iteration. This section covers how these evaluations were performed in order to achieve the results presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:results}.

\todo{The feature extraction module, Section \ref{sec:method:proposed:features}, is described as }In Section \ref{sec:method:proposed:features} the feature extraction module is described as a system that will extract the necessary feature descriptors for material evaluations on the fly. But to reduce the time spent evaluating \todo{from here to end of sentence => ``the feature descriptors of the search space are extracted before all evaluations begin.''} and to avoid removing all the feature descriptors prior to every new evaluation the features were extracted before the exploration of the search space began. 

The evaluation is divided into two parts: How benchmarks are performed in order to achieve the optimal settings for the proposed model and how the model compares with other CBIR studies. 
Since the model requires that a user performs the arduous task of peer-reviewing the predictions of the model every iteration, the simulation of a user was created in order to retrieve data from evaluations.
