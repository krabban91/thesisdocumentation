\section{Related approaches}
\label{sec:method:rel_approaches}
The approach of modeling a system presented in this thesis is, to our knowledge, still untested.
There are however several papers that implement different components of the proposed model.
Most content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems use a set of different feature descriptors that are proven to be good at finding equalities or similarities between images. The system is then presented with a single query image in order to find matches in a database. The images in the database are compared to this query image and the similarities are calculated which is usually some distance measure. If a certain threshold is crossed the images are labeled as similar \cite{wang2001simplicity}\cite{subrahmanyam2013modified}\cite{nagaraja2015low}, e.g. calculating the Euclidean distance and sorting the data having the most similar  data points first.
Other CBIR systems have created a feature vector from extracting certain feature descriptors, trained a neural network with a subset of the data and use the classifier to retrieve images \cite{elalami2014new}. 
There are other implementations where the use of relevance feedback is used in conjunction with the feature descriptors to even further increase performance, in light of the difficulty to identify feature descriptors that are good at ``understanding'' concepts \cite{wang2015new}.
