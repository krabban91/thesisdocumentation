\section{Proposed model}
\label{sec:method:proposed}
This thesis presents a model that uses relevance feedback and CBIR in order to categorize \todo{a search space of}unlabeled data in an iterative and a more efficient manner. The material that has been \todo{verified or recategorized }recategorized by the user through relevance feedback in previous iterations can be used by the model to present better matches in future iterations. The unlabeled search space will in other words shrink as the labeled set for training will grow.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:method:rel_approaches}, the proposed model slightly deviates from other setups. Yet, the general structure is the same as most CBIR systems use. The proposed model consists of three modules; one for matching, one for feature extraction and one that handles relevance feedback. When a search iteration is initiated the matching module fetches a training set and information about the current search space from the feature extraction module, makes elaborate predictions about the material and passes the most accurate information to the relevance feedback module. The relevance feedback module processes the information, requests feedback from the user, passes the ground truths on to the feature extraction model, that updates the search space with new information, and then terminates the iteration which allows a new one to\todo{to be started} start. \todo{The}This communication between the modules during a search iteration can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:meth:proposed:iteration}.
