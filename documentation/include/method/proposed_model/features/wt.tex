\subsubsection{Wavelet transform}
\label{sec:meth:featextr:wt}
The Haar wavelet transform has good performance at a cheap computational cost compared to many other wavelet transforms explained in Section \ref{sec:wlt_feature}. In the proposed model 3 levels of transformation is used, resulting in a $2^3 = 8$ dimensions and a feature vector of length 144. At the end the values are normalized and placed in an array to form the feature vector, the implementation is based on the one featured proposed in \cite{wang2015new}.\todo{further explaining)}
