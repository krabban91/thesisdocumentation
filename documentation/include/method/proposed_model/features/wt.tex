\todo{heading: Haar wavelet transform}
For the wavelet feature transform a Haar wavelet was used\todo{remove this sentence. }. The Haar wavelet\todo{wavelet transform} compared with other wavelets still has a good performance at cheap computational cost \todo{flip order here. good performance, cheap... compared with other wavelets}explained in Section \ref{sec:wlt_feature}. In the proposed model 3 levels of transformation is used, resulting in a $2^3 = 8$ dimensions and a feature vector of length 144. In\todo{At} the end the values are normalized and placed in an array to form the feature vector, the implementation is based on the one featured proposed in \cite{wang2015new}.
