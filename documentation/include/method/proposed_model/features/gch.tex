\subsubsection{Global color histogram}
\label{sec:meth:featextr:gch}

The Global color histogram is implemented as proposed in \cite{wang2015new}, with a few modifications. The the color range of the image is changed to Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV), this color space is covered in Section \ref{sec:HSV_theory}. The intensities of the channels are then stacked depending on which values they have and divided into a number of predetermined bins. In this project they are set as 24, 12, 6 respectively, instead of the 8, 4 and 2 which are used in Wang et al. implementation \cite{wang2015new}. The every bins is summarized with every other bin in the other two channels which gives 24*12*6=1728 different combinations which are divided by the total number of interest points as,
\begin{equation}
H(i) = \frac{n_i}{N} \mbox{ where } (i = 1, 2, ..., 1728),
\end{equation}
where $n_i$ number of interest points, N is the total number of interest points and $i$ are the possible combinations of the bins. $H(i)$ is used to create one of the feature descriptors used by the classifier described in Section \ref{sec:method:proposed:matching:classifier}.

%To generate the Color histogram first the image is changed into HSV color spectra to have a color range that is more akin to the human perception of its environment. Each of the components of HSV are divided into a number of bins in each of the three representations where the number of values in the different ranges are summed together. To normalise the data and make it suggestible to the SVM the number of interest point in each bin is divided with the total amount of interest points in the image. The resulting values form the feature vector of the Color Histogram.
