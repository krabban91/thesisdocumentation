\subsubsection{Convolutional neural network activations}
\label{sec:meth:featextr:cnn}

%To be able to use the VGG net which is implemented in this system the images need to be of size $256*256$ pixels. 
In this implementation\todo{the proposed model} an already trained\todo{a pretrained} neural network is used, \todo{model of the => the network is the }model of the 16-layer network used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition \cite{simonyan2014very}\todo{, also called \emph{VGG-16}}. The network are\todo{is} presented an \todo{$256\times256$}$256*256$ image which is processed\todo{processed by the entire network.}, \todo{The feature descriptors}the features are extracted from the \todo{VGG:s last activation layer => activations of the last fully-connected with 4096 neurons, }VGG:s last activation layer \todo{remove ``before the last fully connected layer and loss layer, after the first fully-connected layers''}before the last fully connected layer and loss layer, after the first fully-connected layers as per Section \ref{sec:vgg_feature}. The vectors are concatenated into a feature vector presentable to the SVM described in Section \ref{sec:mltheory:svm}.
