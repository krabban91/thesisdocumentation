\subsubsection{Convolutional neural network activations}
\label{sec:meth:featextr:cnn}

%To be able to use the VGG net which is implemented in this system the images need to be of size $256*256$ pixels. 
In the proposed model a pretrained neural network is used. The network is the 16-layer network used by the VGG team in the ILSVRC-2014 competition \cite{simonyan2014very}, also called VGG-16. The network is presented with a $256\times256$ image as input which is processed by the entire network. The feature descriptors are extracted from the activations of the last fully-connected with 4096 neurons, as per Section \ref{sec:vgg_feature}. The vectors are concatenated into a feature vector presentable to the SVM described in Section \ref{sec:mltheory:svm}.
