\subsection{Feature extraction module}
\label{sec:method:proposed:features}
The feature extraction module is really \todo{really not a } a part of the workflow during a search iteration. It is, however, a necessary supporting module that centralizes the control of information regarding search space, predefined training sets and the feature descriptors that are extracted. It provides the matching module with information about the search space \todo{space during search iterations and delivers}for the current iteration and delivers a training set in order for the classifier to work. The feature extraction module updates the search space with ground truths when the relevance feedback has been received and makes sure that the presented data can be used as a part of the training set.

When the matching module is exploring the search space \todo{``,''}the feature extraction module ensures that the feature descriptors of material that is about to be classified is extracted. The process that occurs in the background is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:meth:proposed:feature}. If the feature descriptors for a datapoint\todo{data point} is not extracted, the module extracts them and stores them in the databases for future use as well. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro:delimitations}, only 5\todo{five different feature descriptors} feature descriptors are extracted and used. \todo{why these.}
\TODO{Why these descriptors.}
The following Sections covers how these feature descriptors are extracted.
