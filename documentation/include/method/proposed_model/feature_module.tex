\subsection{Feature extraction module}
\label{sec:method:proposed:features}
The feature extraction module is really not a part of the workflow during a search iteration. It is, however, a necessary supporting module that centralizes the control of information regarding search space, predefined training sets and the feature descriptors that are extracted. It provides the matching module with information about the search space during search iterations and delivers a training set in order for the classifier to work. The feature extraction module updates the search space with ground truths when the relevance feedback has been received and makes sure that the presented data can be used as part of the training set.

When the matching module is exploring the search space, the feature extraction module ensures that the feature descriptors of the material that is about to be classified are extracted. The process that occurs in the background is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:meth:proposed:feature}. If the feature descriptors for a data point are not extracted, the module extracts them and stores them in the databases for future use as well. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:intro:delimitations}, only five different feature descriptors are extracted and used. The weak learners were picked one from each class of feature descriptors, descriptors focused on shape, texture and color respectively. The convolutional neural network was chosen as the strong learner with the potential to categorize well on its own and the VGG-16 was chosen as it had a good performance in ILSVRC-2014 and is open for use\todo{Edge detection histogram was implemented because? (We allready had implemented it?)}. The following sections covers how these feature descriptors are extracted.
