\chapter{Machine learning theory}
\label{chapter:mltheory}

This chapter introduces key concepts within the machine learning subfield of out thesis. It will start with a brief overview about machine learning theory and how supervised learning works. The chapter will continue with the classification in general and the basic ideas of Support vector machines. It will then conclude with the key feature of ensemble learning and Deep support vector machines.

% \label{sec:machine_learning}

Machine Learning is a field in computer science focused on methods where the computers learn without being explicitly programmed. Thus can be said to be the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions based upon it. In order for a person to learn about something new, the person looks back on previously learned knowledge and machine learning algorithms do not differ from this pattern. A famous quote that describes machine learning by Tom M. Mitchell is \textit{``A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E''} \cite{Mitchell:1997:ML:541177}. 
Machine learning is applied to several different subjects in a number of different fields. Even though there are several learning methods and utilities of machine learning this thesis will only handle the concepts of supervised learning and classification. Supervised learning will be used as it is a rewarding method when labeled data is attainable.
