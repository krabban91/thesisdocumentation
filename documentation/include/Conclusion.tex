\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}
The \todo{results of the} evaluations that were\todo{are} presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:results} were \todo{based on how the proposed model, described in Section \ref{sec:method:proposed}, initially was designed.}strictly based on how the solution was modeled in the beginning and was presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:method}. With this in mind the achieved results and measurements are discussed here. In this chapter the possible improvements on \todo{of the proposed model}current model are discussed as well as how knowledge extracted from the results can be used in other system designs.
