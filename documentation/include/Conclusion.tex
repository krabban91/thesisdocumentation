\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chapter:conclusion}
The results of the evaluations that are presented in Chapter \ref{chapter:results} were based on how the proposed model, described in Section \ref{sec:method:proposed}, initially was designed. With this in mind the achieved results and measurements are discussed here. In this chapter the possible improvements of the proposed model are discussed as well as how knowledge extracted from the results can be used in other system designs.
